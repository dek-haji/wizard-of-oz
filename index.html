        When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, 
        Toto, are whisked away in their house to the magical land of Oz. They follow 
        the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to meet the Wizard, and en route 
        they meet a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) that needs a brain, a Tin

        The story chronicles the adventures of a young farm girl named Dorothy in the magical 
        Land of Oz, after she and her pet dog Toto, are swept away from their Kansas home by 
        a cyclone.[nb 1] The book is one of the best-known stories in American literature and 
        has been widely translated. The Library of Congress has declared it "America's greatest
         and best-loved homegrown fairytale." Its groundbreaking success and the success of the
          Broadway musical adapted from the novel led Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books
           that serve as official sequels to the first story.

        <h3> Ruby Slipers</h3>
        <p><p>The film begins in Kansas, which is depicted in a sepia tone. Dorothy Gale lives with her dog, Toto, on her Aunt Em and Uncle
            Henry's farm. Toto gets in trouble with a mean neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when he bites her. However, Dorothy's family
            and the farmhands are all too busy to pay her any attention. Miss Gulch arrives with permission from the sheriff to have
            Toto put down. She takes him away, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who then decides to run away from home, fearing
            that Miss Gulch will return.
         </p>
         <p>They meet Professor Marvel, a phony but kindly fortune teller, who realizes Dorothy has run away and uses his crystal ball
            to dupe her into believing that Aunt Em is ill so that she must return home. She races home just as a powerful tornado
            strikes. Unable to get into the storm cellar, she seeks safety in her bedroom. A wind-blown window sash hits her in the
            head, knocking her out. She then awakens to find the house has apparently been picked up and sent spinning up into the
            air by the tornado. She looks outside the window and sees several farm animals, an old lady sitting in a chair knitting,
            two men rowing a boat, and Miss Gulch, who transforms into a cackling witch flying on a broomstick.
